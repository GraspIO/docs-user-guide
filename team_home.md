# Team and Repository Management
From the user home page you can add teams and click on a team's name to open its home page.

## Team Home

On the team home page you can see a dashboard with a history of its member activities, create/delete repositories and manage members and their roles.

## Settings
In the settings section you can see team name and other parameters and change them if you are an administrator for that team.

## Managing Team Members
The "Team Members" section shows a list of users that belong to this team, as well as their roles.

The administrator role allows to manage team repositories and members, as well as delete the team itself.

The regular member role gives access to all repositories that belong to the team.

## Managing Team Repositories
The "Repositories" section shows team repositories. Here you can create a new repository or import a previously exported package to create a copy of that repository or to restore it from a backup. When importing an existing repository, please be careful as this operation will replace all content in it.

In order to export a repository, you need to open the actions menu for it and select "Export" command.

From the dropdown menu you can also open the repository and delete it.
