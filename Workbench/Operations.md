# Performing Workbench Operations

### Creating a Model

In order to create a new model, you need to click on the **&#10753;** sign at the bottom of the explorer tree panel. A dropdown will open with a list of document types (i.e. grammars) that you can use.

Select the type that you need and a popup window will open, asking to enter the model name. Enter some name by which you can later recognize your model, but don't worry, you can always change it later. You won't be able to change the model type though.

### Opening Model for Editing

To open model for editing, simply click on its name in the explorer tree. If some other model was opened in editor, it will automatically close at this point. Grasp saves model edits automatically as you make them, so it should be OK even if you made some changes in the previous model before closing it.

### Saving and Publishing Model Changes

There is no need to do anything to save model changes in the workbench. They are saved automatically. However, in order to make your changes visible to everybody, you need to publish them into the master repository by clicking on the **Publish** button in model editor's toolbar.

### Deleting a Model

The model is deleted through its editor: first you open model for editing, then mark it as deleted, and finally publish this change to the main repository. It is described in the next chapter.

### Renaming a Model

To rename a model you also need to open it for editing and change its name in the Properties tab.

### Organizing Folders

The folders in the workbench explorer are shown automatically accordingly to the organization criteria that you have selected in the explorer tree.

If you chose *organize by grammars*, then a folder is created for each model type (grammar) that exists in the repository.

If you chose *organize by tags*, then you you need to tag your models through the editor shown on the Properties tab, and a chain of folders will be automatically shown for the sequences of tags that you have defined for each model.
