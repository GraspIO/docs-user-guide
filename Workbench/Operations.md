# Repository Operations

## Creating a Document

To create a new model click on the **&#10753;** sign at the bottom of the explorer tree panel. A dropdown will open with a list of available document types.

Select the type that you want and enter the name of the new document in a popup window. You can always rename it later.

## Opening Document for Editing

To open model for editing, click on its name in the explorer tree. Since Grasp saves your edits automatically as you make them, so it is OK to open a new document without closing the previous one first.

##  Saving and Publishing Document Changes

Changes are saved to your private workspace automatically. But in order to make them visible to other users, you need to publish them into the master repository by clicking on the **Publish** button in model editor's toolbar. Each time you do that a new version of the document and generated content is saved in the repository.

## Deleting a Document

To delete a model, open model for editing, then mark it as deleted by clicking on the **Delete** button ("trashcan") on the toolbar, and finally publish this change to the main repository to delete it permanently. Until you publish it you can still recover the document by reverting the change from the toolbar.

## Renaming a Document

To rename a model you need to open it in the editor and edit its name in the header section.

## Managing Folders

There is no concept of user-defined folders in Grasp. The Explorer panel organizes repository documents automatically by their type (grammar) or by userd-defined tags. You can use tags as folder names if you wish.
