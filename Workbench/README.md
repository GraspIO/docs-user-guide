# Workbench

Workbench is a web application through which you work with your private workspace for a Grasp repository.

It opens when you click on a repository link from your dashboard or enter repository URL in a browser. The workspace for it is created automatically when you open some repository for the first time.

The workbench typically contains one or more central views, such as document editor and preview of generated results, surrounded by panels that provide supporting functions: repository explorer, alerts and so on.

The workspace state is persisted on the server, so you can open your workbench later from any place without losing your changes.

It remembers the last document that you worked with and opens it automatically, unless you provide an ID of a different model in the URL.
