# Workbench

Workbench is both a web page and your private workspace through which you work with a specific Grasp repository.

Workbench opens when you click on a repository link from your dashboard or enter repository's URL in a browser. Depending on the URL, it can be used not only to open a repository, but also a specific model in it, and even scroll directly to some element after model is opened.

The actual content of the workbench screen can be different depending on your user role in this repository and layout specified by the repository admin for this role. The main parts are the explorer panel and the editor, which in turn contains several sub-panels.

The workbench state is persisted on the Grasp server, and you can open it from any computer without losing your changes.
