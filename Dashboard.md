# Dashboard

Dashboard is the first thing that you will see as you log into Grasp, unless you work with Grasp in embedded mode, in which case you may not even realize that you are using our platform.

But if you go to the Grasp web site, register and log in, dashboard is the first thing that you see. As of now, it is pretty much work in progress and it contains only two main sections:

* Repositories that you own.
* Repositories that you are connected to.

## Your Repositories
The top list contains your own repositories. You can click on any repository to open a workbench for it.

### Create New Repository
You can create a new repository by clicking on the **&#10753;** sign. You will be asked to enter a name for the repository. Don't worry, you can always change it later.

## Other Repositories
The second list contains references to the repositories for which you have workbenches. A workbench is automatically created when you open repository for the first time. So if someone sends you a link to their repository, you can open it and if you are authorized to access it at least in read-only mode, it will be added to the "Other repositories" list for your future use.
