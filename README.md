Grasp is a platform for editing structured content, such as configuration settings or domain-specific language scripts, and generating code from it.

It provides guardrails to lead through the editing process, so that even non-technical users can author complex documents and generate valid code from them in a format that is expected by the systems and applications that they need to control.

This guide teaches basics of Grasp from the end user perspective. If you are interested in developing your own document schemas (grammars), editor and generator formats, or if you wish to integrate Grasp with external systems, you should also take a look at the [*Developers Guide*](../DevelopersGuide).
