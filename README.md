Grasp is a platform for managing complex structured content, such as configuration, preferences, business logic or even code, without forcing users to learn programming.

It provides tools, help and guardrails that lead you through the editing process, so that you can easily author valid documents, or *models*, in a form that is expected by the systems and applications under your control.

Depending on your role, you may or may not see all capabilities described in the rest of this guide.

If you are interested in designing your own model types (*grammars*) and *formats*, or integrating Grasp with external systems, you should also take a look at the [*Developers Guide*](../DevelopersGuide).

## How Grasp Compares to other Tools

The goal of Grasp is to help people control computer systems and applications, whose number and complexity in our Internet age constantly keeps growing.

Computers speak their own languages, which are different from ours. So in order to instruct them what to do we either need to learn their language and become programmers, or build an interface through which we can conveniently enter our preferences and get them translated into computer instructions.

Programming (writing code, scripts, etc.) is certainly not for everyone, and building custom configuration interface is expensive and time-consuming, not to mention typical rigid structure of such solutions that makes them hard to change over time.

That's where Grasp makes a difference. Using agile model-driven approach, it fills the gap in between rigid table-driven configuration interfaces and freeform code editors, trying to combine the best of both worlds.
