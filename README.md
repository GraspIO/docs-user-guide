Grasp (http://www.grasp.io) is a platform for editing structured content, such as configuration settings or domain-specific language scripts.

It provides guardrails to help with the editing so that even non-technical users can author complex documents and generate code from them.

This guide teaches the basics of Grasp from an end user perspective. If you are interested in developing your own document schemas (grammars), editor and generator formats, or if you wish to integrate Grasp with external systems, you should also take a look at the [Grasp Developers Guide](http://www.grasp.io/doc/DevelopersGuide).
