# Editor Recipe

Recipe is a quick way to edit documents in some format and generate code from them without the need to create a repository or even have a registered user account at Grasp.

It is a simple web page with two main sections:

* Structured document editor;
* Code generation result.

Everybody can create documents with a recipe, save and share them publicly. In addition, registered users can save them to their own private repository.

Recipe is created by implementing a grammar, a code generator and optonally an editor format, and sharing it via a user-selected URL. Please refer to the [Grasp Developers Guide](http://www.grasp.io/doc/DevelopersGuide/Integration/editor_recipe) for additional details.
