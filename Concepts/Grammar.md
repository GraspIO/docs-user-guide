# Grammar

Grammar is a special kind of a model that describes a schema for other models. Sometimes it is also called metamodel. Grammar defines classes for model elements.

Thanks to a grammar, your documents will contain only the right fields with the right values in them, and this will make it easy to translate your input into other representations.
