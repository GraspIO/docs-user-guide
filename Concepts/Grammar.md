# Grammar

*Grammar* is a special type of a model that describes how other models should be structured. Sometimes it is also called *metamodel*, but we won't spend much time on the terminology right now.

It will be sufficient to say that, thanks to the grammar, your model document will contain only the right fields with the right values in them, and it will make it easy for computers to understand what you are trying to say through this model.

In Grasp each element in each model has a *class*, which is described in some grammar and dictates which information such element can have.
