# Repository and Workbench

A group of related models, grammars and formats is typically organized into a repository. You can create multiple repositories for different needs or connect to repositories created by other users, or link them into your own repository.

When you open a repository in Grasp, it will create a private workspace for you that is called workbench. Workbench stores changes that you've made until you are ready to publish them into the main repository to create a new version. Until that nobody will see your local modifications.

Workbench can show a different perspective of the repository depending on your role and the type of the document you work with. Sometimes you will see a repository explorer and other views and panels, and sometimes only a single editor and generated result will be shown.
