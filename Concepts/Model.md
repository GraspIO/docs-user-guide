# Model (Document)

Models contain hierarchical data structures or structured documents. They consist of elements, simple or complex attributes and references to other elements.

As a user you will view and change them via an intelligent editor that converts their hierarchical data structure into what looks like, well, a document.

While you edit such document, one or more generators may work behind the scenes to translate it into different forms - a code.
