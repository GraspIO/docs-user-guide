# Model

*Models* are documents that form main building blocks of Grasp. They store your input in a structured form that is half-way between our natural way of communicating information and the way how computers prefer it. It is more structured than regular text, but is less rigid than, for example, database tables.

Anyways, as a user, you don't normally need to know what this form is, because you will work with the model through an intelligent editor that will both present it in a form that is easy to understand.

What exactly can be put in a model? That really depends on your needs, but pretty much anything. Configuration settings, policies, scripts, preferences... As long as developers can design a grammar for it.

Models consist of *elements*, and elements can contain *attributes* (simple values or complex elements) and *references* to other elements.
