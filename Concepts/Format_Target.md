# Format and Target

Format is a special kind of model that transforms information stored in a structured document into a user-readable ot machine-readable form.

There are two types of formats:

* Editor format describes how to present the document in an editor.
* Output format, also called generator, describes how to transform your model into something that computers can understand, i.e. turn it into a code.

Same model type can have multiple alternative ways of representing it in an editor and generating its output. Each of them will have its own format.

The results of code generation from a model by an output format are called targets. They can be saved locally or instantly delivered to the applications that need them.
