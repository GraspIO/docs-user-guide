# Grasp Concepts

Grasp can be viewed as a content management system, language workbench, or even a document-oriented database, depending on what concepts you are more familiar with.

It stores your content in structured grammar-driven documents that are called models, and groups them together into repositories accessible via your own private web-based workbench.

Model content can be presented to you on the screen or deployed into your target applications in various forms by applying a specific editor or generator format.
