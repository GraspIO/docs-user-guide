# Main Concepts

Grasp can be compared to a content management system or a database, depending on what you are more familiar with.

It stores your content in structured documents that are called *models*, and groups them together into *repositories* which you can access via your own private *workbench*. Model structure is described by its *grammar* and is shown to you or delivered to your target system in a desired form by applying a *format*.
