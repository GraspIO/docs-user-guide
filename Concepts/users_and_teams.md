# User and Team

Users create and own content in Grasp, i.e. its repositories or specific models in them.

An unregistered or anonymuous user can see public repositories created by other users but cannot publish changes into them.

Registered user can create repositories and become a member of a team.

A team is a group of people that can share repositories to  access them together. Teams have administrators to manage their settings.

A repository always belongs to a team. Each user always has a personal team under his/her name but can create more teams if needed.
