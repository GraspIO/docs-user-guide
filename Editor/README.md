The editor perspective opens when you click on model name in the Explorer.

It contains toolbar, main view where the active document is shown and optionally additional views with other documents that may be helpful to see at the same time. Different views can be turned on and off by clicking on their view toggles in the main toolbar.

The type of the editor used by Grasp is called structured, or projectional, editor. It takes hierarchical data structure of your model and generates a HTML document where you can click on elements and fields and edit them in place.

The formatting of the document in the view can be changed by clicking on the "format" icon next the its name.

When needed, you can quickly maximize editing area by double-clicking on its toolbar.

Changes in the editor are saved to your private workspace automatically, but need to be published into the main repository before other users can see them.

Undo history stored in your workspace until you publish model changes into the master repository.

Typically editor view is constructed from the following sections:

- View header where you change the format in which the document is presented and in some cases select a different document of the same type.
- Model head editor where you can change document's name, description, tags, etc.
- Model body editor where you see the actual document.
