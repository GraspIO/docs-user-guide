# User Home

User home is the first page that you see after logging into Grasp.

It has 3 main sections:

* Dashboard with a history of recent activities related to the teams and repositories you may be interested in.
* List of repositories that you own or have workbenches for.
* List of teams that you own or are a member of.

## Repositories
This list contains your repositories and those that you have connected to in the past. From here you can open them, create a new repository or find and open an existing repository created by somebody else. Once you open it, the link to your new workbench will be added to your repository list.

## Teams
A team is a group of people that can share repositories to  access them together.

After signing up as a Grasp user you will automatically get a team under your own name. You can create additional teams from your home page.
